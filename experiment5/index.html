				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project involves generating an image with the use of shapes using p5.js move around till it makes something that looks similar to the actual image.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>This project uses gaussian noise to handle the mutation of all the shapes that help make up the image.</li>
                    <li>Designed to be configurable with things like handling the size,shape,number and color of the shapes.</li>
					<li>The mutation process makes incremental changes to your design. The rate parameter should be implemented in a way that allows the user to almost stop exploration by sliding the rate down to 1%. Your generator must respond to the mutation rate slider.</li>
                    <li>There is a weird issue with the gereantion that being you have set the mutaion rate to 1% and then swap to a different image to have a really close to refernce image result.</li>
                </ol>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Annealing</h2>
                <p>The most interesting results from this kind of evolutionary generator are often achieved by continually adjusting the mutation rate. Set the slider to 100%, reset the generator, and then slowly drag the slider down to 1% over the period of about 30 seconds. This allows the generator to make large design changes at the start while allowing it to focus on finely details towards the end. This is best done by hand while watching the outputs improve because you can use your human judgment to decide when the generator needs to be making bigger or smaller changes to keep making progress.
                </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was an interesting project and was very fun to have some of my own images being created in front of my eyes using random shapes. I am particully proud of how bubbly the images lool with the use of eliplses to make up the image. I still dont understand why the code has the behavior of having a near perfect image only after I set the rate to 1% and then go to a different image and have that image look nice instantly, I feel like I have too many elements and too many variations for it to run in a meaningful amount of time.</p>
